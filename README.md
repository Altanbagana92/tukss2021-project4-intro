# Building an ERP with BPMN &amp; Workflow Engines
## TuKSS2021 Group Project #4 Intro

Get to know the technologies used in this project:

* Install the Camunda Platform (the open-source workflow engine, we recommend using Docker) & the Camunda modeler: https://camunda.com/download/
* Follow the Camunda Quick Start guide: https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/quick-start/
* We recommend you follow the examples using JavaScript and NodeJS in the Quick Start Guide
* Note any observations you make along the way (feedback for the Camunda folks).
* Join the [Camunda University Slack](https://camunda-university.slack.com), search the [Camunda Forum](https://forum.camunda.org) or ask the teaching team in case of questions.
* Adapt the example to a small custom workflow that is relevant for you (and adapt the worker script). Maybe some data can be fetched from a [remote API](https://apilist.fun)?
* Publish the BPMN diagram and the worker code together with your notes in this GitHub repository in a separate folder and tell us about it.
